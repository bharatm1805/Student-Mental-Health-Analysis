# Introduction
Mental health is an important topic but often overlooked in society. In particularly, mental health tends to be de-prioritized on university campuses, but university can sometimes be one of the most stressful and formative times in many students' lives. Through this project, we hope to gain a better picture of student mental health and provide some recommendations to universities based on the findings.

# Data
The dataset was collected from a Canadian university through a self reported online questionnaire. The dataset contains 1192 completed questionnaires. The questionnaire included questions about demographic, recreational and academic hobbies, self-care habits, mental health and changes in mental health during the pandemic.

In the dataset, there were several mental health score that we will be referring to in this project. They are the following:

DERS16: Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-16; Bjureberg et al., 2016) Scores are summed and range from 16-80, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of emotional dysregulation.
DASS21: Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) Scores are summed and doubled. Higher scores reflect higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress
GAD2: Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2 items (GAD-2; Kroenke et al., 2007) Scores are summed. Mild anxiety is represented by scores of 0-3 and severe anxiety by scores of 4-6.
PHQ2: Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2; Kroenke et al., 2003). Scores are summed. If the score is 3 or greater, major depressive disorder is likely.
PSS10: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1983).
Scores are summed. Scores of 27-40 represent high perceived stress levels.

# Key Findings
Here, the key findings are:

Poor mental-health is a real concern among students.
Mental-health scores tend to vary across different ethnicities and genders. In particular, those self-identified as non-binary had higher DASS scores and DERS scores, indicating greater struggle with depression, anxiety, and stress.
Few people sought professional mental health services, even if they did have higher mental health scores.
Students who take part in some kind of volunteering tend to have better mental-health compared to those who do not.
First year students who live alone off-campus tend to struggle more with mental-health related problems.
The Covid-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on the mental-health of students.
Students who included some kind of exercise in their schedule had better mental-health scores than those who did not.

# Conclusion
Based on our findings in this notebook, we have the following recommendations to hopefully improve mental health across university campuses. The recommendations are:

Hosting and supporting more inclusive social events, hobbies, and physical activities to help increase overall campus mental health
Creating specific mental and emotional support groups for non-binary individuals and for other ethnic minorities on campus
Generating more awareness of mental health resources and ensuring its accessibility to students
Prioritizing inclusive and social events for first-year students to ensure a smooth transition
Ultimately, universities should take extra care and effort in providing more student activities and initiatives to improve campus mental health. students and universities need to collectively discuss mental health issues on campus to generate awareness and ensure all groups of students are included in the discussion. More research can be done on understanding minority experiences to ensure that campus minority groups are understood and initiatives reflect their needs as well.
